# presales-jenkinsjobs
processJobs.sh is a simple utility to export/import jobs to Jenkins.

Enhancements that **should** be done:
* Allow for entry of Jenkins server (currently hard coded)
* Handling of spacess in job names so posts can work
* Handling the case if the Jenkins CLI isn't available or if there is a version issue
